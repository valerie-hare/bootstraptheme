# bootstraptheme
In my Front End Web Development II class, I used a Bootstrap theme from Themefisher.com to create a simple portfolio SPA (single-page application). I used this layout to customize the HTML and created a SASS file. Then, I used the SASS version to compile the CSS version for browsers.
